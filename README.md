# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It showcases my cloud engineering experience, side projects, and academic background in a clean, minimal interface.

## The site includes:
- A simple homepage with an intro, experience/education, projects, and contact links
- A projects section with modal previews and image carousels
- A resume viewer with an embedded PDF
- Light/Dark theme support
